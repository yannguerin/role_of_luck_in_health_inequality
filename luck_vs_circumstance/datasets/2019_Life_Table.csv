Footnotes:
1,"Three-year complete life tables are also available in table 13-10-0114 for Canada and all provinces, except Prince Edward Island. For Prince Edward Island and the territories, three-year abridged life tables can be found in table 13-10-0140."
2,"Population estimates are final intercensal up to 2020, final postcensal in 2021, updated postcensal in 2022 and 2023 and preliminary postcensal for 2024. For more details, please refer to the document Methods for Constructing Life Tables for Canada, Provinces and Territories (Statistics Canada catalogue number 84-538)."
3,"Life tables for the years 2022 and 2023 are considered “preliminary”. These tables will be updated at a later time to take into account deaths that could have occurred but have not yet been recorded (late registrations)."
4,"The single-year life tables are well suited for granular analysis of temporal variations and to single out the most recent trends. However, three-year life tables provide more robust estimates of mortality indicators and time series that are less prone volatility on a short-term horizon (see table 13-10-0114). For these reasons, three-year life tables may be better suited for comparisons between regions or analysis of long-term mortality trends, particularly in less populated provinces."
5,"Complete life tables (by single years of age) are available for Canada as a whole and for nine provinces: Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. For Prince Edward Island, Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, abridged life tables (by 5-year age groups) were computed. The population sizes of this province and the three territories were too small to allow the calculation of complete life tables with accuracy. The abridged life tables can be found in table 13-10-0140."
6,"Data on deaths that occurred in Yukon and deaths of residents of Yukon that occurred in other provinces or territories are not available from 2017 to 2022. Owing to that lack, life tables have not been calculated for Yukon for these reference periods. For all years in which death data are available, they are included in life table calculations for Canada."
7,"Number of persons in an initial cohort of 100,000 live births who are still alive at the beginning of each subsequent age. The number of survivors decreases as age increases, under the effect of mortality. It is possible to compute, from the number of survivors, the probabilities of survival between two ages. For example, if the number of survivors is 99,297 at age 10 and 98,935 at age 20, the probability of surviving from age 10 to age 20 is 98,935 / 99,297, that is, 0.99635."
